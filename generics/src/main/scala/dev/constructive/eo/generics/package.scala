  * Scaffolds on Mateusz Kubuszok's [hearth](https://github.com/MateuszKubuszok/hearth)
  * macro-commons library.
  *
  * Derived setters call the primary constructor directly (`new S(...)`, never `.copy`) — uniform
  * across case classes and enum cases, but the emitted call carries no outer accessor, so derive
  * only for '''top-level''' ADTs, not types nested inside a class.

  /** Derive a lens from one or more case-class field accessors. Two-step partial application —
    * `lens[Person](_.age)` — pins `S` while letting the focus type be inferred. Works on any
    * N-field case class or Scala 3 enum case (emits `new S(…)`, doesn't require `.copy`).
    *
    * The return type is arity-and-cover driven:
    *   - partial cover, one selector → `SimpleLens[S, A, XA]` with `XA` the NamedTuple complement
    *     of the non-focused fields;
    *   - partial cover, N ≥ 2 selectors → `SimpleLens` with NamedTuple focus in '''selector'''
    *     order and NamedTuple complement in '''declaration''' order among non-focused fields;
    *   - full cover at any arity (including `lens[Wrapper](_.value)` on a 1-field case class) →
    *     `BijectionIso[S, S, NT, NT]`.
    *
    * Even at arity 1 the full-cover focus is a 1-field NamedTuple, so
    * `lens[Wrapper](_.value).get(w)` yields `(value = 42)`, not the bare `42`.
    *
    * Monocle users: this is `GenLens[S](_.field)` / `Focus[S](_.field)`, except nested paths are
    * compile errors (chain `.andThen`), full cover takes the `GenIso` role, and enum cases work.
    *
    * Selectors must be single-field accessors — nested paths (`_.a.b`), duplicates, and unknown
    * fields are compile errors.
    *
    * The declared `Optic[S, S, ?, ?, ?]` on `PartiallyAppliedLens.apply` is not the type you get:
    * `transparent inline` narrows the result to the concrete `SimpleLens` / `BijectionIso` at each
    * call site. Never ascribe the wildcard type to a derived optic — the ascription throws the
    * narrowing (and the fused overloads that ride on it) away.

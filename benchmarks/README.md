# `cats-eo` benchmarks

A JMH harness with two layers:

1. **Optic-overhead micro-benches** comparing `cats-eo` against
   [Monocle](https://www.optics.dev/Monocle/) on the operations both
   libraries implement (Lens / Prism / Iso / Traversal / Getter / Setter /
   Fold / Optional / AffineFold), plus EO-only carrier benches
   (`MultiFocus[PSVec]` / `MultiFocus[List]` traversals and aggregators).
2. **Canonical-schema integration benches** — one realistic `Order` document
   navigated identically across all three byte/AST backends (circe / jsoniter /
   avro), each measured against the same baselines so the real-world
   "edit-without-decoding" story is directly comparable. See
   [*Canonical-schema integration*](#canonical-schema-integration-real-world).

**The `benchmarks/` sub-project is deliberately outside the root
aggregator** — `sbt compile` and `sbt test` skip it. Run explicitly.

## Running

Trustworthy numbers (five iterations, three warm-ups, three forks) — the
`bench` sbt alias bakes in that config (single source of truth; append a JMH
filter to scope it):

```sh
sbt bench                          # whole suite
sbt "bench .*OrderAvroBench.*"     # one class
```

Quick smoke check (faster, noisier — useful while iterating on a bench, not for
comparisons) via the `benchQuick` alias (`-i 3 -wi 2 -f 1`):

```sh
sbt benchQuick
```

The raw forms still work if you need a non-standard config:

```sh
sbt "benchmarks/Jmh/run -i 5 -wi 3 -f 3 -t 1"
sbt "benchmarks/Jmh/run -i 1 -wi 1 -f 1 -t 1"
```

> The per-bench `@Fork`/`@Warmup`/`@Measurement`/`@BenchmarkMode`/
> `@OutputTimeUnit`/`@State` preamble can't be shared via a trait *or* a
> meta-annotation (JMH reads its config off the concrete class only — see the
> `JmhDefaults` scaladoc); these aliases centralise the *invocation*, which is
> the part that safely can be.

Or run them reproducibly in CI: the **Benchmarks** workflow
(`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`, manual `workflow_dispatch`) runs a JMH
filter at `-f 3 -wi 3 -i 5` on a GitHub-hosted runner, renders a summary table
to the Actions UI, and uploads `jmh-results.json` as an artifact. A shared CI VM
is not a quiet machine — treat the output as reproducible *directional* data per
JMH's disclaimer below.

Filter by class (`.*` is JMH's regex syntax):

```sh
sbt "benchmarks/Jmh/run -i 5 -wi 3 -f 3 -t 1 .*OptionalBench.*"
sbt "benchmarks/Jmh/run -i 5 -wi 3 -f 3 -t 1 .*Order.*"
sbt "benchmarks/Jmh/run -i 5 -wi 3 -f 3 -t 1 dev.constructive.eo.bench.OrderCirceBench.eoStreet"
```

Enable a profiler (see `-prof list` for available):

```sh
sbt "benchmarks/Jmh/run -i 5 -wi 3 -f 3 -prof gc .*LensBench.*"
sbt "benchmarks/Jmh/run -i 5 -wi 3 -f 3 -prof stack .*PowerSeries.*"
```

## Environment caveats

JMH's own disclaimer applies in full:

> The numbers below are just data. To gain reusable insights, you
> need to follow up on why the numbers are the way they are.

Specifically — the numbers are only meaningful when:

1. The machine is quiet (close Chrome, no background builds).
2. CPU frequency scaling is disabled or locked to a steady state.
3. `-f` ≥ 3 (the default `@Fork(3)` annotations honour this when
   invoking without `-f`).
4. The JVM is recent enough that JMH's `@Fork`-injected runtime
   detection works; the build targets JDK 17 and JDK 21.

### Composition + EO-only carrier benches

The three `PowerSeries*` benches are **Monocle-paired** (`eo` / `naive` / `monocle`):
they compose Lens/Traversal/Prism, which Monocle does natively, so each ships a
`monocle_*` peer built from the same chain (with a `@Setup` guard asserting the
paths agree). The `MultiFocus*` / `JsoniterBench` rows below are genuinely EO-only
— they probe carrier internals (`MultiFocus[PSVec]` reductions) or compare the two
EO JSON backends, where there is no Monocle analog.

| Bench class              | Subject | Monocle peer |
|--------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| `PowerSeriesBench`       | `Lens → Traversal.each[ArraySeq, Phone] → Lens` over `Person.phones` (sweeps 4/16/64/256/1024/4096) | `MLens.andThen(MTraversal.fromTraverse).andThen(MLens)`. |
| `PowerSeriesNestedBench` | 5-hop `Company → List[Dept] → ArraySeq[Emp] → Boolean` (sweeps 4/16/64/256/1024 × 4-dept fanout) | Monocle 5-hop `Lens→Traversal→Lens→Traversal→Lens`. |
| `PowerSeriesPrismBench`  | `Traversal.each[ArraySeq, Result] → Prism[Result, Int]` on a 50/50 Ok/Err mix (sweeps 8/32/128/512/2048) | Monocle `Traversal.andThen(Prism)`. |
| `MultiFocusBench`        | `MultiFocus[List]` (`fromLensF`) vs `MultiFocus[PSVec]` (`Traversal.each`) on the same `Lens → List/each → Lens` chain (sweeps 4/32/256/1024) | None. The unified carrier that absorbed the v1 AlgLens/Kaleidoscope/Grate/PowerSeries families. |
| `MultiFocusCollectBench` | `collectMap` (ZipList mean / `Const` sum), `collectList` (cartesian-singleton), and `MultiFocus.tuple` 3-/6-slot modifies | None. Carrier-level reduction / broadcast machinery. |
| `JsoniterBench`         | Cross-EO: `eo-jsoniter` (byte-walk) vs `eo-circe` (AST) read/write at depths 3/4, miss path, `[*]` fold-sum, and `replace`/`modify` writes | None. The two EO JSON backends head-to-head on the same bytes. |

All micro-benches share the same shape: a paired `eoXxx` / `mXxx` method per metric, so the generated JMH report shows them side-by-side in one table.

`AffineFoldBench` (`AffineFold.getOption` at depths 0/3/6 against Monocle's `Optional.getOption`) rounds out the Monocle-paired set; Monocle 3.x ships no standalone `AffineFold`, so it sits between the paired and EO-only tables.

### Canonical-schema integration (real-world)

One shared [`Order`](src/main/scala/dev/constructive/eo/bench/fixture/Domain.scala)
event — deliberately **deep** (`customer.address.street`, depth 3), **wide**
(≥5 fields per level), **arrayed** (`lines: List[LineItem]`), and **optional**
(`customer.loyaltyId`) — drives every integration bench on the *same logical
schema*, so the three byte/AST backends are directly comparable.

Each metric ships every relevant baseline side-by-side in one report row.
The vocabulary is consistent across backends:

- `eo*` / `eoIor*` — the EO optic (silent `*Unsafe` hot path and, where it
  differs, the default `Ior`-bearing surface).
- `naive*` — full decode → modify → re-encode; materialises the whole
  record. The "what you'd write without optics" baseline, present in every
  backend.
- `native*` — a hand-optimized, backend-specific path that **avoids the full
  read**. Only jsoniter ships one here: a `JsonReader` codec that walks to the
  focus and `skip()`s every sibling. It's exactly what eo automates generically
  — and a correctness guard in the bench's `@Setup` asserts it agrees with the
  full decode. circe and avro have no separate `native*`; eo *is* their partial
  walk.
- `hcursor*` / `direct*` (circe only) — two ways to edit the circe AST without
  decoding: `HCursor` (whose `.top` replays the zipper to rebuild — sometimes
  *slower* than a full decode) vs direct `JsonObject` surgery (rebuild only the
  touched parents).
- `monocle*` — decode to the case class, run a Monocle optic, re-encode. Monocle
  has no byte/AST carrier, so it pays the same full round-trip as `naive*` — it's
  a reference point alongside the hand-written baseline, not a separate story.

| Bench class          | Foci | Baselines | Notes |
|----------------------|------|-----------|-------|
| `OrderCirceBench`    | `customer.address.street` modify; `lines[*].name` traversal | `eo`/`eoIor`/`naive`/`hcursor`/`direct`/`monocle` | circe `Json` AST |
| `OrderJsoniterBench` | `customer.address.street` read+write; `lines[*].price` fold | `eo`/`native` (partial scan, reads + fold)/`naive`/`monocle` | Raw `Array[Byte]`. `[*]` is read-only in jsoniter phase-1.5, so its array story is a fold, not a write traversal. |
| `OrderAvroBench`     | `customer.address.street` read+write; `lines[*].name` write traversal | `eo`/`naive`/`monocle` | `IndexedRecord`. `loyaltyId` omitted — kindlings encodes `Option` as a union navigated via `.union[Branch]`, not a transparent field. |

`@Param size ∈ {8, 64, 512}` grows the surrounding document so the
edit-without-decoding cost (depth/size-insensitive) shows against the
decode-modify-encode baselines (O(all fields)). The one case where `eo ≈ native`
is the fold — scanning a whole array can't skip an AST.

### Shared fixtures

Two shared fixtures under `dev.constructive.eo.bench.fixture`:

**`Domain`** — the canonical [`Order`](src/main/scala/dev/constructive/eo/bench/fixture/Domain.scala)
event used by every integration bench (`Order*`). `Domain.mkOrder(n)` builds a
deterministic order with `n` line items. `DomainMonocle` holds the shared Monocle
peers (`street` / `names` / `prices`) every `monocle*` baseline runs against.
Per-backend codecs (circe / jsoniter / avro) live in each bench's companion so a
backend that fails to derive can't block the others.

**`Nested`** (`Nested0` … `Nested6`) — the depth-parameterised case-class chain
used by the Monocle-paired micro-benches `OptionalBench`, `GetterBench`,
`SetterBench`. Each leaf carries:

- `value: Int` — Lens / Getter / Setter focus
- `flag: Option[String]` — Optional focus (with Some-default and empty-default leaf variants)
- `items: List[Int]` — Fold focus (FoldBench builds its own list parameterised by `-P size`)

## Composition notes

Not every optic family composes in EO via the universal `Optic.andThen`:

- **`Lens.andThen(Lens)`** — `Tuple2` carrier, composes cleanly.
- **`Prism.andThen(Prism)`** — `Either` carrier, composes cleanly.
- **`Iso.andThen(Iso)`** — `Forgetful` carrier, composes cleanly.
- **`Traversal.andThen` via `MultiFocus[PSVec]`** — works, but pays the
  `MultiFocus[PSVec]` machinery cost (see `PowerSeriesBench`).
- **`Lens.andThen(Optional)`** — works via cross-carrier `.andThen`. `Affine.assoc[X, Y]` carries no Tuple bound, so a `Morph[Tuple2, Affine]` lifts the Lens chain into the Affine carrier automatically; no explicit `.morph` step on the call site.
- **`Getter.andThen(Getter)`** — blocked: Getter's `T = Unit` vs the outer `B = A` in the `Optic.andThen` slot. The bench nests `get` calls manually: `leaf.get(n1.get(n2.get(...)))`.
- **`Setter.andThen(Setter)`** — blocked: `SetterF` has no `AssociativeFunctor` instance. The bench nests `modify` calls: `n1.modify(leafSetter.modify(f))`.

For Monocle side, every corresponding `andThen` is first-class on the optic trait.

The remaining Getter/Setter workarounds reflect what a user would actually write if composing these families in EO today. The cleaner Monocle side isn't a bench advantage — the work done on both sides is the same Scala code with the same allocations.

## Interpreting PowerSeries numbers

All three PowerSeries benches scale **linearly** with traversed-collection size; the eo-to-naive ratios tighten as size grows (fixed per-op setup amortises).

Current eo-to-naive ratios (see [benchmarks.md](../site/docs/benchmarks.md#powerseries-traversal-with-downstream-composition) for full tables incl. the Monocle peer):

- **`PowerSeriesBench` (dense `Lens → Traversal → Lens`):** 4.6× at N=4 → 2.7× at N=1024.
- **`PowerSeriesNestedBench` (5-hop tree):** 5.0× at N=4 → 3.2× at N=256.
- **`PowerSeriesPrismBench` (Prism miss-branch):** ~5.2–5.6× across sizes — Prism miss plumbing (per-element Either-tag write + miss-branch `ys` slot) is the inherent cost.

Under the hood the hot paths use two private fast-path markers on the `MultiFocus[PSVec]` carrier. Prism/Optional morphs mix in `MultiFocusPSMaybeHit` (maybe-hit), whose `collectTo` writes directly into pre-sized flat `Array[Int]` + `Array[AnyRef]` builders (`IntArrBuilder` / `ObjArrBuilder`) without per-element `Either`/`Option` wrappers. Lens morphs mix in the carrier-wide `MultiFocusSingleton` (always-hit), which additionally skips the length-tracking `Array[Int]`. `pEach.to` zero-copies `ArraySeq.ofRef` inputs into a `PSVec.Slice`, and `pEach.from` hands the result `Slice`'s backing array straight to `ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` via `unsafeShareableArray` when the Slice densely covers it.

Use `Traversal.each` / `pEach` (carrier `MultiFocus[PSVec]`) for both single-pass element-wise modifies and chains that continue past the traversal — same optic, same `.modify`, with `.foldMap` for read-only aggregation and `.andThen` for downstream composition.

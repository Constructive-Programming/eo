/** Laws governing [[Composer.chain]] — the mechanism that lifts a series of pairwise `Composer`s
  * into a multi-hop carrier coercion. Promoted from the earlier `eo.laws.eo.ChainLaws` in Unit 7 so
  * downstream projects adding a new carrier can verify their `Composer` instances as first-class
  * typeclass laws, not as optic-shape-specific EO-laws.
  *
  * C1. Composer path independence — when two distinct intermediate carriers reach the same end
  * carrier, both `modify` paths produce identical output. C2. Composer preserves `get` — for a
  * chain whose carriers all expose `Accessor`, the `get` extension on the composed optic agrees
  * with the uncomposed optic's `get`.

/** C1 — `Composer.chain` path independence.
  *
  * From `Forgetful` there are two direct composers (→ Tuple2, → Either) and from each of those a
  * direct composer to `Affine`. So an `Iso` can land in `Affine` via two distinct chains. They
  * should be modify-equivalent — otherwise `Composer.chain` would be making the caller's choice of
  * intermediary observable.
